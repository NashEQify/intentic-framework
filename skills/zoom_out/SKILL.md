# Skill: zoom-out

## Purpose

When the user doesn't know a code area / module / topic well,
don't deliver a detail answer first; deliver a **map** of the
relevant modules + callers + domain vocabulary. Detail comes
after the map.

## Source

Lifted from `github.com/mattpocock/skills`
(`skills/engineering/zoom-out/SKILL.md`, 2026-04-30). The
Pocock skill is 2 lines ("Go up a layer of abstraction. Give me
a map of all the relevant modules and callers, using the
project's domain glossary vocabulary.") — user-only via
`disable-model-invocation: true`. Same pattern here, with a
slight extension for domain-glossary hints.

## Standalone

Distinct from:
- `skills/improve_codebase_architecture/SKILL.md` — codebase-wide
  refactor discipline with 3 phases. `zoom_out` is a quick map
  lookup, not a refactor.
- `skills/frame/SKILL.md` — problem analysis with 8 sub-steps.
  `zoom_out` is context lookup, not problem framing.
- `skills/scoping/SKILL.md` — L0-L3 decomposition. `zoom_out`
  is a read-only map, not a decomposition.

What only this skill delivers:
- Quick "how does X fit into the picture" map without process
  discipline.
- User-explicit-only (`disable-model-invocation: true`) — not
  auto-discovered.
- Bridge between user uncertainty and the detail question.

## When to call

- User says "zoom out" / "give me bigger picture" / "how does
  that fit into the picture".
- User asks a detail question about a code area they don't
  know well (symptom: "why is that so?" / "what does that
  actually do?").
- Pre-refactor orientation when
  `improve_codebase_architecture` is too heavy.

### Do not call for

- A detail-coding question with clear scope → answer directly.
- Architecture refactor → `improve_codebase_architecture`.
- Problem analysis with a solution space → `frame`.
- Spec hierarchy decomposition → `scoping`.

## Process

### Output

A map at 3 layers above the detail:

1. **Modules** in the area: what lives here (files / classes /
   functions).
2. **Callers:** who calls what (import graph, one hop).
3. **Domain vocabulary:** which terms (CONTEXT.md if present,
   otherwise derived from code comments + spec refs).

Format: short text + table OR ASCII tree, NOT long prose.

### Vocabulary discipline

Use existing domain vocabulary (CONTEXT.md if present,
otherwise project-specific spec terms). Prevent drift on
"component / service / API" (cross-ref
`improve_codebase_architecture` strict glossary when relevant).

BuddyAI-specific when relevant: brain facade / context assembly
/ materialization / navigate / entry points / 5-layer model.

### After-map

After the map: address the user question again with the new
context. Detail now rides on map vocabulary.

## Red flags

- Long prose instead of a map (the user wanted a map).
- Introducing your own vocabulary instead of the existing
  domain glossary.
- Map without after-map (the user needs both).
- Map as a full refactor plan (that's
  `improve_codebase_architecture`).

## Common rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "User asked a detail question" | The user used the trigger phrase. Map first, then detail. |
| "Map is overhead" | A user-explicit trigger means the user wants the map. Otherwise it would not be invoked. |
| "No CONTEXT.md, so no glossary possible" | Code comments / spec refs / agentic-design-principles.md provide vocabulary. |

## Contract

### INPUT
- **Required:** user trigger (pattern list above) OR user
  detail question on an unfamiliar code area.
- **Required:** read access to the codebase.
- **Optional:** CONTEXT.md with domain glossary.
- **Context:** no cross-refs needed.

### OUTPUT
**DELIVERS:**
- Map: modules + callers + domain vocabulary.
- After-map: detail answer with map context.

**DOES NOT DELIVER:**
- No refactor plan.
- No ADR.
- No spec.
- No code changes.

**ENABLES:**
- The user can now read the detail question with context.
- Pre-refactor orientation.
- Onboarding for a new area.

### DONE
- Map with all 3 layers (modules / callers / vocabulary).
- After-map addresses the original user question.
- Domain vocabulary consistent with the existing project
  glossary (no drift).

### FAIL
- **Retry:** the map is too vague → pull in more concrete
  files / caller paths.
- **Escalate:** the codebase is too large for a map → ask the
  user which sub-area.
- **Abort:** the codebase is not accessible → escalate to the
  user.
