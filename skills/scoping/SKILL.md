# Skill: scoping

## Purpose
Translate a brutal high-level intent into a complete, approved
spec hierarchy (L0-L3). Buddy guides the user progressively
through every level.

## Trigger
- The user phrases a high-level intent: "build me X", "I need
  Y", "create an app for Z".
- The intent is an **objective** (concrete undertaking with a
  foreseeable done criterion) — not a task, not an unframed
  problem.
- No sufficiently detailed spec draft exists yet.

**Distinguish task vs objective vs problem:**
- Task: clearly bounded, one spec is enough, the user knows
  what they want → directly to spec + board
  (`workflows/runbooks/build/WORKFLOW.md`).
- Objective: vague, multiple features, longer time horizon,
  **but a foreseeable done criterion** → scoping mode.
- Problem: the done criterion itself is unclear, the solution
  shape is open (spec? process? code? ADR?) → `solve` workflow
  instead of scoping.

**On uncertainty between problem and objective:** prepend
`frame/SKILL.md` mode `quick`. The frame report clarifies whether
the result will be an objective with a spec hierarchy (then
scoping) or a different artifact (then `solve` stays).

## Spec hierarchy

| Level | Name | Content | Gate |
|-------|------|---------|------|
| L0 | Intent spec | Why, for whom, constraints, done criterion, non-goals | User approval |
| L1 | Architecture spec | Components, data flow, tech decisions, risks + spec tree | Board + user |
| L2 | Feature spec | Per feature: behaviour, edge cases, acceptance criteria | Board + user |
| L3 | Implementation spec | Per component: interfaces, state, error handling, contracts | Board, autonomous |

---

## Flow

```
1. RECOGNIZE: Buddy recognizes an objective → announces scoping
   mode.
   "That's still very generic. Let's start — I'll guide you
   through the requirements."

2. L0 ELICITATION: 5-7 questions, one at a time.
   → Write the L0 draft.
   → User approval (no review panel).

3. L1 ELICITATION: only delta questions (what L0 didn't yet
   clarify).
   → Write the L1 draft.
   → Board (quick or deep, depending on the trigger).
   → Derive the spec tree (explicitly, not implicitly).
   → User approves the L1 spec + spec tree together.

4. L2 ELICITATION: per feature from the spec tree, in dependency
   order.
   → Delta questions per feature.
   → Board → user approval.
   → Next feature (or in parallel when there is no dependency
     — post-harness).

5. L3: autonomous.
   → Buddy generates implementation specs from the L2 ACs +
     L1 architecture.
   → Board (autonomous, escalate on convergence failure).
   → Post-L3 summary to the user (max 1 page, no gate).
```

## Progressive elicitation

**Principle:** every level only gets the delta questions — what
the previous level didn't yet clarify.

| Level | Already known | What is now clarified |
|-------|---------------|------------------------|
| L0 | Nothing | Why, for whom, key constraints, done criterion, non-goals |
| L1 | Intent + constraints | Component cuts, data flow, tech stack, risks |
| L2 | + architecture | Per feature: behaviour, edge cases, ACs |
| L3 | + feature ACs | Buddy generates autonomously — no elicitation |

**Conversation style:** one question — wait for the answer —
follow up if needed — then continue. Never a list of 7 questions
at once.

---

## L0 elicitation — question catalogue

Buddy picks 5-7 by context. Pre-check: unclear problem framing
→ prepend `frame/SKILL.md` mode `quick`, then decide if L0
elicitation makes sense.

1. Primary purpose — what should the system do that doesn't
   work today?
2. Who uses it? (User groups, other systems, Buddy itself.)
3. Where does it run? (Self-hosted, cloud, hybrid — sovereignty
   constraint.)
4. What is explicitly NOT in scope? (Non-goals.)
5. When is it "done"? (Done criterion, testable.)
6. Hard constraints? (Security, performance, budget,
   technology.)
7. What already exists that has to be integrated?

---

## Deriving the spec tree (L1 output)

After the L1 draft, Buddy explicitly derives the spec tree:

```markdown
## Spec tree: <system name>

| Feature spec | Scope (one sentence) | Dependencies |
|-------------|----------------------|--------------|
| L2-01: <name> | <what does it do?> | — |
| L2-02: <name> | <what does it do?> | L2-01 |
| L2-03: <name> | <what does it do?> | — |
```

The user approves the L1 spec **and** the spec tree together.
L2 elicitation only starts after approval.

**Dependency order:** L2 specs with dependencies are only
authored after the predecessor spec is approved. The dependent
spec receives the predecessor as `referenced_spec` in the
review handover.

---

## Backtrack protocol

When Buddy spots a fundamental L0 mistake during L1 elicitation:
BACKTRACK signal to the user with two options — (A) revise L0
then continue with L1 (recommended), or (B) document the
assumption and continue. The user decides; no silent continuing
on a faulty foundation.

**Sharpening vs extension:** sharpening doesn't change any AC
(`spec_version`++, continue). Extension adds an AC or changes
scope (board delta review needed).

---

## L3 — post-L3 summary

After every L3 spec is closed, Buddy sends:

```
## L3 summary: <system name>

The following implementation specs were generated and reviewed
autonomously:
| Spec | Most important decision | Accepted risks |
|------|-------------------------|----------------|
| L3-01: <name> | <one sentence> | — |
| L3-02: <name> | <one sentence> | AR-1 (see spec) |

No gate — you can intervene now before implementation starts.
On objections: [A] revise the spec | [B] proceed.
```

## Outputs

`workspaces/<objective>/specs/`: `l0-intent.md` ·
`l1-architecture.md` · `l1-spec-tree.md` ·
`l2-<feature-name>.md` (per feature) ·
`l3-<component-name>.md` (per component) ·
`review-history/` (l1/l2/l3-rounds.md per gate run).

## Contract

### INPUT
- **Required:** high-level intent (objective) — "build me X",
  "I need Y".
- **Required:** the intent is an objective (foreseeable done
  criterion, multiple features).
- **Optional:** existing partial specs — for delta elicitation.
- **Context:** no external context needed — scoping works in
  dialog with the user.

### OUTPUT
**DELIVERS:**
- L0 intent spec (why, for whom, constraints, done criterion,
  non-goals) — user-approved.
- L1 architecture spec (components, data flow, tech decisions,
  risks) + spec tree — board + user-approved.
- L2 feature specs (per feature: behaviour, edge cases, ACs) —
  board + user-approved.
- L3 implementation specs (per component: interfaces, state,
  error handling, contracts) — board-approved (autonomous).
- Post-L3 summary to the user.

**DOES NOT DELIVER:**
- No coding — scoping ends at the L3 specs; implementation
  starts via `build`.
- No architecture decisions — on >1 path → `council` or
  `solution-expert`.
- No problem analysis — on an open solution shape → `solve`
  workflow.

**ENABLES:**
- Build workflow: L2 / L3 specs as delegation-ready artifacts
  for MCA.
- Spec board: L1 / L2 / L3 specs as review input.
- Task creation: feature decomposition → tasks per L2 / L3
  spec.

### DONE
- L0 user-approved.
- L1 board-approved + user-approved (incl. spec tree).
- All L2 specs board-approved + user-approved.
- All L3 specs board-approved (autonomous).
- Post-L3 summary sent to the user.
- Specs persisted under `workspaces/<objective>/specs/`.

### FAIL
- **Retry:** board NEEDS-WORK → fix → re-board per level.
- **Escalate:** backtrack signal on a fundamental L0 mistake →
  the user decides (revise or document the assumption).
- **Abort:** the user aborts scoping → existing specs remain
  as a draft.

## Boundary

- **No unframed problem** — on an open solution shape →
  `solve` workflow (prepend `frame quick` on uncertainty).
- **No single task** — when one spec suffices → `build`
  workflow directly with the specify phase.
- **No ADR** — architecture decision with >1 path → `council`
  or `solution-expert`.
- **No coding process** — scoping ends at the L3 specs;
  implementation starts via `build`.

## Anti-patterns

- **NOT** ask 7 questions at once. **INSTEAD** one question, an
  answer, possibly a follow-up, then continue. Because:
  multi-question lists lead to shallow answers and lost
  nuances.
- **NOT** start L1 without user approval of L0 + spec tree.
  **INSTEAD** L0 approved, then L1 elicitation. Because: a
  faulty L0 spreads through every level.
- **NOT** continue on a faulty L0 when L1 analysis shows a
  problem. **INSTEAD** backtrack signal to the user, offer
  options. Because: silent continuing leads to specs that have
  to be fundamentally revised later.
- **NOT** skip scoping on multi-feature objectives because "in
  a hurry". **INSTEAD** push through progressive L0 → L1 → L2
  elicitation. Because: multi-feature objectives built without
  decomposition collapse during implementation.
