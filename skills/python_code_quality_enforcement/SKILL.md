# Skill: python-code-quality-enforcement

## Purpose

Enforce Python code quality and conventions for BuddyAI.
Defines tooling, layouts, coding standards, and security
checks for all Python code in the project.

Inspired by Trail of Bits' `modern-python` skill. Adapted for
BuddyAI's stack: FastAPI, PydanticAI, NATS, Neo4j, LiteLLM.

## Who runs it

Every agent that writes or reviews Python code. Buddy enforces
on delegation (checklist section 8). Primary consumer:
`agents/main-code-agent.md`.

## Triggers

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| New Python code is written | The agent follows these conventions |
| Code review / PR | The reviewer checks against these conventions |
| New package / dependency added | `pyproject.toml`, no requirements.txt |
| Task [040] Gateway kickoff | Make sure the tooling is in place (extend ruff rules, install security tools) |

---

## 1. Project layout

```
BuddyAI/
  pyproject.toml          # the only build/dependency definition
  src/buddyai/            # source root (src layout)
    __init__.py
    brain/                # knowledge layer
    gateway/              # runtime layer (FastAPI)
    workers/              # NATS consumer workers
    harness/              # orchestration
    models/               # Pydantic models (shared)
    events/               # event schemas + stream defs
    skills/               # Python skills (PydanticAI tools)
    scheduler/            # APScheduler jobs
  tests/                  # tests (mirror of src/buddyai/)
    unit/
    integration/
    fixtures/
  .venv/                  # local virtual environment
```

**Rules:**
- The `src/` layout is required. No flat layout.
- One `pyproject.toml` — no `setup.py`, no `setup.cfg`, no
  `requirements.txt`.
- `__init__.py` in every package — even when empty.

### First-time setup

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

---

## 2. Dependency management

### pyproject.toml (SoT)

```toml
[project]
requires-python = ">=3.12"
dependencies = [...]          # runtime deps

[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = [...]                   # dev/test deps
```

### Rules

- **Every dependency in pyproject.toml.** No
  `requirements.txt`, no `Pipfile`.
- **Version constraints:** `>=x.y` for libraries, no `==`
  pinning (a lock file owns exact pinning when introduced).
- **Add a new dependency:** under `[project.dependencies]` or
  `[project.optional-dependencies.dev]`. Then run
  `pip install -e ".[dev]"` in the venv.
- **No global `pip install`.** Everything in the venv.

### Later (when uv is introduced)

uv as a drop-in for pip / venv. Commands:

```bash
uv venv .venv              # instead of python -m venv
uv pip install -e ".[dev]" # instead of pip install
uv pip compile             # generate the lock file
```

Currently: not installed yet. Standard pip + venv is enough
for phase 2.

---

## 3. Code quality: ruff

ruff is linter + formatter in one. Replaces flake8, black,
isort.

### Current config (pyproject.toml)

```toml
[tool.ruff]
target-version = "py312"
line-length = 120
src = ["src"]

[tool.ruff.lint]
select = ["E", "F", "I", "N", "W", "UP"]
```

### Rule sets

| Code | What | Why |
|------|------|-----|
| E | pycodestyle errors | base style |
| F | pyflakes | dead imports, undefined names |
| I | isort | import sorting |
| N | pep8-naming | naming conventions |
| W | pycodestyle warnings | style warnings |
| UP | pyupgrade | use Python 3.12+ syntax |

### Extended rules (turn on at Task [040] kickoff)

```toml
select = ["E", "F", "I", "N", "W", "UP", "B", "SIM", "RUF", "ASYNC", "S"]
```

| Code | What | Why |
|------|------|-----|
| B | flake8-bugbear | common bugs (mutable defaults, etc.) |
| SIM | flake8-simplify | constructs that simplify |
| RUF | ruff-specific | ruff's own rules |
| ASYNC | flake8-async | async / await mistakes (relevant for FastAPI) |
| S | bandit (security) | security patterns (eval, exec, hardcoded passwords) |

**Caution on activation:** existing code in `src/` has bare
`except Exception:` (S110) and `subprocess.run()` in tests
(S603/S607). Before activation:
1. Run `ruff check --select B,SIM,RUF,ASYNC,S src/ tests/`
   (dry run).
2. Fix auto-fixable issues:
   `ruff check --fix --select B,SIM,RUF,ASYNC,S src/`.
3. Review non-auto-fixable issues one by one; if needed,
   `# noqa: S110` with rationale.

### Execution

```bash
# Lint
.venv/bin/ruff check src/ tests/

# Format
.venv/bin/ruff format src/ tests/

# Fix (auto-fixable issues)
.venv/bin/ruff check --fix src/ tests/
```

ruff runs in the venv (installed via the `dev` deps). No
global install needed.

---

## 4. Testing: pytest

### Config (pyproject.toml — SoT)

```toml
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
testpaths = ["tests"]
markers = [
    "integration: L3 integration tests (need DB / NATS)",
    "e2e: L4 end-to-end tests (need running services)",
    "contract: L3 contract tests (need OpenAPI schema)",
    "property: L5 property-based tests (hypothesis)",
    "smoke: L4 smoke tests (against production endpoints)",
    "eval: eval tests (verify hypotheses with code)",
]
asyncio_mode = "auto"
asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope = "session"
asyncio_default_test_loop_scope = "session"
```

**Note:** `pyproject.toml` is the SoT. When this config and
the real `pyproject.toml` diverge: adjust pyproject.toml (not
the other way round).

### Conventions

- **Test files:** `test_<module>.py` — mirror of the src
  structure.
- **Test functions:** `test_<what_is_tested>()`.
- **Fixtures:** in `conftest.py` at the right level (tests/,
  tests/unit/, tests/integration/).
- **Async tests:** `async def test_...()` — pytest-asyncio in
  auto mode.
- **Integration tests:** marker `@pytest.mark.integration`.
  Need DB / NATS. Testcontainers for Postgres + Neo4j (in
  dev deps).

### Execution

```bash
# All unit tests
.venv/bin/pytest tests/unit/

# Integration tests (need Docker)
.venv/bin/pytest tests/integration/ -m integration

# With coverage (src layout: point the path at src/buddyai)
.venv/bin/pytest --cov=src/buddyai --cov-report=term-missing tests/

# Single test
.venv/bin/pytest tests/unit/test_models.py::test_specific -v
```

### Test-pyramid mapping

See `skills/testing/SKILL.md` for the 6-level pyramid. This
skill defines only the pytest mechanics, not the test
strategy.

## 5. Security tooling

### detect-secrets (required from phase 2)

Prevents API keys, passwords, tokens from landing in the
code.

```bash
# Create the baseline
detect-secrets scan > .secrets.baseline

# Audit against the baseline
detect-secrets audit .secrets.baseline
```

**Status:** not installed yet. Set up at Task [040] kickoff:

```bash
.venv/bin/pip install detect-secrets
detect-secrets scan > .secrets.baseline
```

### pip-audit (required from phase 2)

Audits dependencies for known vulnerabilities (CVEs).

```bash
.venv/bin/pip-audit
```

**Status:** not installed yet. Set up at Task [040] kickoff:

```bash
.venv/bin/pip install pip-audit
```

---

## 6. BuddyAI-specific conventions

### Pydantic models

- All shared models in `src/buddyai/models/`.
- `model_config = ConfigDict(...)` instead of `class Config`.
- Validators via `@field_validator` (Pydantic v2 syntax).
- No `from_orm` — Pydantic v2 uses `model_validate`.

### FastAPI

- Routers in separate files
  (`gateway/routes/sessions.py`, etc.).
- Dependency injection via `Depends()`.
- Response models explicit: `response_model=SessionOut`.
- No `*` imports.

### NATS / JetStream

- Event schemas in `src/buddyai/events/schemas/`.
- Stream definitions in `src/buddyai/events/streams/`.
- Consumer pattern with error handling:
  ```python
  async for msg in subscription:
      try:
          payload = json.loads(msg.data)
          await process(payload)
          await msg.ack()
      except Exception:
          logger.exception("consumer_error", subject=msg.subject)
          await msg.nak(delay=5)  # redeliver after 5s
  ```

### Neo4j

- Queries as string constants (no f-string injection).
- `user_id` in EVERY query (multi-user from day one).
- Transactions via `async with driver.session() as session:`.

### Async / await

- No `asyncio.run()` in library code (only in entrypoints).
- `asyncio.to_thread()` for blocking I/O (e.g. RLM
  completion, subprocess).
- No mixing of sync / async in the same module without a
  clear reason.

### Imports

- Absolute imports:
  `from buddyai.models.session import Session`.
- No relative imports (`from .models import ...`) except in
  `__init__.py`.
- Import order (enforced by ruff `I`):
  1. stdlib.
  2. third-party.
  3. local (`buddyai.*`).

### Logging

- `structlog` (not stdlib `logging`).
- Logger per module:
  `logger = structlog.get_logger(__name__)`.
- Structured: `logger.info("event_name", key=value)` — no
  f-string in log messages.
- **Migration:** some existing files still use
  `import logging`. On touch, switch to `structlog`. No
  big-bang refactor.

---

## 7. What NOT

- **No mypy / ty (currently).** Pydantic + ruff UP + runtime
  validation are enough for phase 2. Evaluate type checkers
  later when the codebase grows. Write type annotations
  anyway — they serve as documentation and Pydantic uses
  them at runtime.
- **No pre-commit framework.** CC hooks are the mechanism
  for pre-commit checks. A separate pre-commit framework
  would conflict with that.
- **No CI / CD.** No GitHub Actions. Everything local. CI
  comes later when needed.
- **No uv (yet).** Standard pip + venv is enough. uv when
  needed (large dependency trees, lock files).

## 8. Checklist on code delegation

Buddy verifies on every code delegation to main-code-agent:

- [ ] New code under `src/buddyai/` (src layout)?
- [ ] Tests under `tests/` (with the right marker)?
- [ ] Dependencies in `pyproject.toml` (not
  requirements.txt)?
- [ ] `ruff check` + `ruff format` clean?
- [ ] No secrets in the code (API keys, passwords)?
- [ ] Async patterns correct (no `asyncio.run` in libraries)?
- [ ] Structured logging (structlog, not print / logging)?
- [ ] `user_id` in Neo4j queries?
